Build a startup website by HTML CSS and bootstrap

This project is a summary of my studies in HTML and CSS. 
I built a virtual home screen for a startup that helps dog owners find nearby playmates for their pets.
You can view the interface by going to Environment->View deployment, you can also access via https://gebbing12.github.io/stratup-website/
